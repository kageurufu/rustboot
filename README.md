rustboot
========

A simple rust EFI kernel

Goals are for a simple EFISTUB bootloader, a`la systemd-boot or gummiboot

really long term goals include graphical mode?

[boot.iso](boot.iso) is a debug built boot image, suitable for VirtualBox booting

Create a basic Virtualbox image, enable EFI, and set this as the CD-Rom. It should just work

I cant get qemu with ovmf to work though
